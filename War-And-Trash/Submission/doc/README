The shuffle algorithm can be found on line 61 in the function called shuffle within the main.cxx file.
To run the program, simply cd to the proper directory and run make.
I had issues with figuring out the Trash, most likely with my approach. 
The program gets stuck and runs in an infinite loop, so Trash may not run to completion.
The issue could be a memory leak.
I also had issues running grader.sh
